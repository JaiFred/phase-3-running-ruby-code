#app.rb

puts "Hello World!"

# This is the equivalent of calling:
# puts [1, 2, 3].inspect
# p [1, 2, 3]

p [1, 2, 3]

# The pp method will "pretty-print" these objects by calling the .pretty_inspect method on our data.

# pp [{ id: 1, hello: "World" }, { id: 2, hello: "Ruby" }, { id: 3, hello: "Moon" }, { id: 4, hello: "Learner" }]

 # type "irb" to get into irb

 # In Ruby, it's convention to use underscores (_) to separate words in variables. This is referred to as snake case (as opposed to camel case, which is the convention in JavaScript).

 # You can exit IRB by typing exit, or pressing ctrl + d.

 # RSpec is a Ruby gem (the Ruby equivalent of a npm package) that provides a domain-specific language, or DSL

 puts "Pass this test, please."
